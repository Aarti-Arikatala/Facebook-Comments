# Facebook-Comments
NLP project to analyze the comments scraped from Illinois Facebook county health pages. 
The 9000 comments were cleaned an emojis were unicoded. 
The comments were further broken down to county level where I ran a frequency counter to count the different types of words being used, to identify sentiments and community building. 
The frequency counter was run with and without stemming. 
I also implemented a structure topic modelling algorithm to understand the general topics being discussed in Illinois Counties related to COVID-19. This analysis was conducted by both stm plots and word clouds
