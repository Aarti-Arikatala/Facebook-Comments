# Facebook-Comments
NLP project to analyze the comments scraped from Illinois Facebook county health pages. 
The 9000 comments were cleaned an emojis were unicoded. 
The comments were further broken down to county level where I ran a frequency counter to count the different types of words being used, to identify sentiments and community building. 
The frequency counter was run with and without stemming
